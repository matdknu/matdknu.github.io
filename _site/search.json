In this work, we analyse the structure of local and regional market of player transfers in popular eSports discipline Dota 2.

We gathered the dataset of player transfers for the top professional teams and their transfer partners, based on transactions between two world tournaments: TI 16 to TI 17. In our work, we built a directed network of transfers and analyzed centralities, assortative mixing, and link formation with the help of ERGM model.
