## Offerings

- Strategic advising on study design, data governance, and reproducible workflows for social research teams.
- Reviews of notebooks, scripts, and visual narratives to keep analysis transparent and maintainable.
- Short workshops (virtual or on-site) that translate methods into actionable practices for researchers, NGOs, or teams in transition.

## How we work together

1. Send a short email (`m.deneken@uc.cl`) or LinkedIn message describing the project scope or questions.
2. We schedule a kickoff chat, define goals, and agree on deliverables (notes, reviewed code, workshop plan).
3. Insights from each engagement feed back into the “Experience in Research” blog so teams see how knowledge spreads.
